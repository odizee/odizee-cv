      <h3>Dear Recruiter,</h3>
      <p>
        I am a dynamic, energetic and performance-driven Frontend developer with
        over two years’ experience. I am enthusiastic, goal oriented and
        confident in achieving tasks and organisational objectives. In 2017, I
        completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Banking and Finance at the
        University of Benin, Benin City.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had experience in developing web pages as a freelancer, using
        WordPress and related tools. I make sure all my pages are responsive and
        optimized before delivering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have previously interned with HNG and came out as a finalist in the
        just concluded internship. I interned as a frontend developer (React). I
        played a major role as a code merger for the frontend sub group in my
        team, making sure that codes are carefully looked at before merged into
        the team’s Github repository. I made use of technologies like micro
        frontends (Single SPA).
      </p>
      <p>
        These experiences have helped me develop core skill set in HTML,
        Javascript, CSS, React development, Redux, Webpack, Styled Components,
        SCSS, GIT, interpersonal and team-working skills. It has also enhanced
        my verbal and written communication skills. Moreover, I have excellent
        leadership, technical and analytical skills. I am very keen to leverage
        the opportunities present in the world of frontend development and the
        software development and I am certain I would make a valuable addition
        to your organisation. The knowledge and skills built up during my time
        in HNG/Zuri makes me a right candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am confident that I can bring an outstanding level of success with me
        to your organisation and help you build upon your reputation. With my
        expertise, I believe my contribution will have an immediate impact in
        your organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my candidacy further. I thank
        you for your time and consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yours faithfully, <br /> Odiri Ighogboja
